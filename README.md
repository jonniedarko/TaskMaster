# Task Management App

See it live on [Vercel](https://task-master-omega-eight.vercel.app)

## Introduction

This Task Management App is designed to efficiently manage tasks with a user-friendly interface. It is built using SolidJS, a declarative JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, chosen for its performance benefits and simplicity. This application allows users to create, view, and categorize tasks based on their status and priority.

## Work Breakdown

1. **Task UI Component Development**: Design and implement task cards.
2. **Modal Implementation**: For task creation and editing.
3. **State Management**: Implement SolidJS reactive state for task management.
4. **Styling with Tailwind**: Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling components.
5. **Testing**: Set up Jest for unit testing and write initial tests.
6. **Documentation**: Create README and inline code comments for clarity.

### Assumptions made

- For tasks data I just hard coded an array of `Task`, I will discuss further down a potential backend design
- I did not implement any validation in current Implementation but I would expect to validate the fields on the task prior to creating.

## My Design

I choose to keep a very clean and simple layout
While not requested in the brief, I choose to lay this out in a Kanban style as it felt inline with the product requirements.

### Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools

- **UI Frameworks:**
  - SolidJS: chosen for its fine-grained reactivity and efficient rendering while still supporting react like JSX making easier for react devs to follow.
  - for notifications https://github.com/ardeora/solid-toast
- **Testing**: Jest - well known and well supported
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS - for its utility-first approach
